Formed during the Covid pandemic, Amalgam managed to play together virtually from their homes using music software similar to Zoom. 
Over this time they wrote much of the material for their first album "Colours", which they released in 2023. 
To date they've played their original tunes as well as a broad array of jazz standards at local venues.  They're presently working on new material which they look forward to playing at a venue near you very soon!
